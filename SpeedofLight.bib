	abstract = {The discovery of the finite nature of the velocity of light is usually attributed to Rømer. However, a text at
the Paris Observatory confirms the minority opinion according to which Cassini was first to propose the ‘successive
motion’ of light, while giving a rather correct order of magnitude for the duration of its propagation from the Sun to the
Earth. We examine this question, and discuss why, in spite of the criticisms of Halley, Cassini abandoned this
hypothesis while leaving Rømer free to publish it.},
